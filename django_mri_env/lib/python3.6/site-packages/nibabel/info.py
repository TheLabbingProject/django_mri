Read / write access to some common neuroimaging file formats

This package provides read +/- write access to some common medical and
neuroimaging file formats, including: ANALYZE_ (plain, SPM99, SPM2 and later),
GIFTI_, NIfTI1_, NIfTI2_, `CIFTI-2`_, MINC1_, MINC2_, `AFNI BRIK/HEAD`_, MGH_ and
ECAT_ as well as Philips PAR/REC.  We can read and write FreeSurfer_ geometry,
annotation and morphometry files.  There is some very limited support for
DICOM_.  NiBabel is the successor of PyNIfTI_.
